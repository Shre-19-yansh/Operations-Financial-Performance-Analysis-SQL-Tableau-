# 📊 Operations & Financial Performance Analysis 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses operational and financial performance data to evaluate how effectively production planning translates into execution. Using SQL for analysis and Tableau for visualization, the project examines production efficiency, cost behavior, profitability, and capacity utilization to derive actionable business insights.
It is designed to reflect real-world analytical tasks expected in **data analyst internship roles**, including variance analysis, KPI tracking, and dashboard-driven storytelling.




## 📂 Repository Structure
- **README.md** – Project documentation  
- **Case_Study_Solution.md** – Question, SQL Queries and Visulization used for analysis and decision making.     
- **OFRD** – Operational dataset containing production volume, revenue, cost components (labour, material, energy, fixed), shift details, production lines, plan vs actual
             metrics, and time dimensions (date, week, month, quarter)




  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare **planned vs actual** performance across production, cost, and profit  
- Measure **production efficiency** and its consistency over time  
- Identify **key cost drivers** and sources of margin pressure  
- Analyse **time-based trends** (monthly, quarterly, weekly, daily)  
- Evaluate **shift-wise capacity utilization**  
- Detect **volatility, anomalies, and performance deviations**




### Key Dimensions
- Date  
- Weekday  
- Week Number  
- Month  
- Quarter  
- Shift configuration (1 / 2 / 3 shifts)  
- Production lines operating per shift  

### Key Metrics
- Planned vs Actual Production Volume  
- Planned vs Actual Revenue  
- Cost components:
  - Labour  
  - Material  
  - Energy  
  - Fixed  
- Operating Profit  
- Operating Margin  
- Product mix (Small / Medium / Large units)  
- Production efficiency indicators  



## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
### SQL
- Aggregations and groupings  
- Window functions (`LAG`, rolling averages)  
- Variance, ratio, and trend analysis  
- Correlation and volatility analysis  

### Tableau
- Interactive dashboards  
- KPI summaries  
- Time-series and comparative visualizations  



## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Data Understanding & Validation
- Inspected data structure and metric definitions  
- Validated planned vs actual fields  
- Ensured consistency across time dimensions  

### 2. SQL Analysis
Key analyses performed:
- Operating profit by month and quarter  
- Planned vs actual variance analysis  
- Production efficiency calculation  
- Revenue growth and volatility analysis  
- Cost structure and cost overrun evaluation  
- Shift-wise and capacity utilization analysis  
- Rolling averages and anomaly detection  

### 3. Tableau Visualization
Built dashboards to visualize:
- Production efficiency trends  
- Cost structure (planned vs actual)  
- Revenue, cost, profit, and volume over time  
- Best and worst performing periods  



## 🔍 Key Insights
- Production efficiency remains consistently high (~98%), indicating strong operational execution  
- Actual costs exceed planned costs throughout the year, with pressure increasing in the second half  
- Material cost is the dominant expense and primary source of cost escalation  
- Operating margins decline over time as costs grow faster than revenue  
- Shift utilization evolves from a two-shift model to a balanced three-shift structure  
- Short-term volatility exists despite stable long-term growth  



## 🧩 Skills Demonstrated
- SQL querying and advanced aggregations  
- Window functions and analytical logic  
- Variance, efficiency, and profitability analysis  
- Business-focused interpretation of data  
- Tableau dashboard design and KPI storytelling
